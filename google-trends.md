# Google Trends — Intended Use (FindNext)

FindNext uses aggregated Google Trends interest data to detect changes in public search demand for handmade and creative topics. Data is used only at the theme/category level for directional signals (e.g., rising/flat/declining interest) and is not used to identify individuals.

- Access: Public, aggregated Google Trends data
- Data type: Non-personal, anonymized, aggregated interest index
- Use: Signal weighting and context in TrendGraph
- Storage: Only derived aggregates (e.g., normalized indices), no raw user-level data
